## 📌 Project Overview
Weather data is highly dynamic and continuously updated, making it challenging to analyze and present in a meaningful way. This project focuses on building an interactive **Weather Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI**, integrating real-time data from a **Weather API**.

The goal of this project is to transform raw API data into a visually clear and analytical dashboard that provides insights into current weather conditions, air quality, pollution levels, and short-term forecasts. This dashboard is designed to support quick interpretation and data-driven understanding rather than static reporting.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how live weather data can be collected, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Power BI. The dashboard aims to provide a consolidated view of weather indicators such as temperature, humidity, wind conditions, air quality, and rainfall probability, all within a single interactive page.  

Another key objective is to showcase the use of **API-based data integration**, **DAX calculations**, and **effective dashboard storytelling** to convert complex, continuously changing data into actionable insights.

## 🌐 Data Source Description
The data used in this project is sourced from a **Weather API**, which provides both current and forecasted weather information. The API returns semi-structured data that includes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, air quality index (AQI), pollution metrics (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2), rain probability, and sunrise and sunset timings.

Working with API data required careful handling to ensure the data was properly structured and ready for analysis within Power BI.

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation and Transformation
The Weather API data was connected to Power BI and processed using **Power Query**. During this stage, the raw data was cleaned, transformed, and structured into an analysis-ready format. Missing values were handled, unnecessary fields were removed, and relevant columns were formatted appropriately.

Additional calculated columns and measures were created to improve interpretability and to support analytical reporting. This step ensured that the dataset was accurate, consistent, and optimized for visualization.

---

## 🧮 DAX Calculations and Measures
To enable meaningful analysis, **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** measures were created for key weather indicators. These measures were used to calculate temperature metrics, classify air quality levels, analyze pollution intensity, and support forecast trend visualization. DAX played a crucial role in converting raw numerical values into interpretable indicators that enhanceE.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Design and Features
The final output of this project is a **single-page interactive dashboard**, designed intentionally to keep the analysis simple and readable. The dashboard presents current weather conditions, air quality indicators, forecast trends, and rain probability in a visually intuitive layout.

Interactivity is enabled through filters and visual elements that allow users to explore weather conditions across different time periods or locations. The focus of the design is clarity, minimalism, and ease of understanding rather than complexity.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
The dashboard highlights several important insights derived from the weather data. The analysis shows that Bengaluru generally experiences moderate temperatures with relatively high humidity levels. The Air Quality Index indicates healthy air conditions during the observed period. Forecast trends reveal noticeable variations in temperature across days, and rain probability analysis helps identify days with higher chances of precipitation.

These insights demonstrate how real-time weather data can be effectively translated into practical, easy-to-understand information.

---


## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of **Power BI for real-time analytics**, highlighting skills in API integration, data transformation, DAX calculations, and dashboard design. It reflects an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data extraction to insight generation, and emphasizes the importance of presenting complex data in a clear and meaningful way.
